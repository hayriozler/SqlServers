## What is it?

  TDE is a technology to secure your database at rest(Rest means that I/O subsystem or drives or backup tapes). The main purpose of the TDE is to protect your data and log files at the disk level. An encrypted database could not be restored or moved to another server without the required certification. When you enabled TDE at the database level, you don't need to make any changes on the application side.

  TDE was introduced in SQL server 2008. It was only applicable for Enterprise versions when it was introduced. Since 2019 The TDE has been available for the Standard edition as well.
